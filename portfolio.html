          A sort of clone of Dwarf Fortress, the fantasy world simulator and
          story generator that inspired Minecraft. I've been exploring ideas
          around computer-assisted storytelling for a bit, and watching a lot of
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/kruggsmash">Kruggsmash's videos</a>
          on YouTube. I want to make a world simulation which can support
          sufficient complexity that it starts supporting interesting stories.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm learning a lot of game development principles from just running
          headlong into problems and coming up with naive solutions, which I can
          refine over time.

          An an interactive horror fiction inspired by '80s text-based adventure
          games, literary fiction, and the terminal console. It is nerdy, queer,
          verbose, and deeply personal.

        <p>
          The main marketing website for Periscopic, where I work as a front-end
          developer. I had my fingers in a lot of pies in this project, but one
          of the pieces I'm most proud of is the the opening animation and
          impact selector, which we called the "Impact Wall". Lining up the
          background image to the text mask was a beastly task!
        </p>
        <p>
          I also designed the data loading scheme, which is a naive and
          unfortunate GraphQL client implementation. I learned a lot while
          building it. The biggest lesson I learned was to just use Apollo
          instead. We used
          <a href="https://strapi.io/">Strapi</a> for content management because
          it serves GraphQL natively.

          An app to look at huge amounts of data about fish in the Pacific
          Northwest! I worked on features all across this app, from data
          ingestion to map rendering to performance improvements, but I was
          entirely responsible for the

          The goal-exploration tool is the first project on which I was the lead
          developer. I made virtually all of the technical decisions on the
          front-end, contributed to the design process, and wrote all of the
          code.

        <p>
          This project was intended to be a report card for politician's
          friendliness to animal welfare issues. In addition to the
          accountability tool, I used Wordpress as a headless CMS to construct a
          blog and marketing site. The theme and marketing site I created is no
          longer online.
