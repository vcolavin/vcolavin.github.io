		<h1><a href="./">Vincent Colavin</a>'s Amazing Temporary Portfolio</h1>
		<p>
			My fancy new portfolio is in progress. It'll be really impressive, I
			promise. In the meantime, please enjoy this universally accessible,
			radically lightweight, user friendly document.

					I work full-time, so I don’t do a lot of open-source work in
					my spare time. Sometimes, though, the spirit moves me and I
					put a few hours into my main active project. It’s still
					evolving, but right now it’s an interactive fiction inspired
					by 80s text-based adventure and the terminal console. In a
					word, it is nerdy. In more words, it’s nerdy and strange and
					literary and deeply personal.

				<h2>Pacific Salmon Explorer</h2>

					An app to look at huge amounts of data about fish in the
					Pacific Northwest! I worked on features all across this app,
					from data ingestion to map rendering to performance
					improvements, but I was entirely responsible for the
					<a href="http://salmonexplorer.ca/#!/export=1">
						on-demand PDF generation
					</a>
					. Warning, some PDFs are very data heavy and may take a long
					while to load.

				<p>2018, 2019</p>
				<p>
					A way of finding information about higher education
					attainment rates in the United States. I was also entirely
					responsible for the development of the Predictive Tool,
					which is currently hidden behind that “coming soon” button.
					It’s really cool, I promise.

					The coolest part of this suite of sites for AWA is the
					<a href="https://cat.animalwellnessaction.org/"
						>Congressional Accountability Tool (CAT)</a
					>. However, I built the blog,
					<a href="https://tpa.animalwellnessaction.org/"
						>The Political Animal</a
					>, using a good old-fashioned custom WordPress theme. I
					learned it from scratch in a couple of weeks, and had a lot
					of fun building the custom theme.
