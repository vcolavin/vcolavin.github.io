          Hello! I'm a front-end (mostly) web developer in Portland, Oregon. I try to spend most of my time writing React, TypeScript, and futuristic CSS. I used to do a lot more Ruby and SQL.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although I'm a professional JavaScript person, I advocate for accessibility, mobility, stable UIs, and simplicity in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm also a volunteer at a suicide crisis line center called Lines for Life. As a person of privilege, I believe strongly in working towards the liberation and uplift of oppressed people.
        </p>

          <span>
            A solo personal project which is currently on hiatus, mid-development. It is an art piece I built to master my preferred stack: Postgres, a Rails-powered API, and a React + Redux front-end. It's going to be strange and relaxing, I hope.
            <br>
            <a href="http://restful-forest.herokuapp.com/">Click here to see the API in action!</a> It might be a bit boring until the front-end is built :)

          <span>
            A jacket with variable-length sleeves (just like in Back to the Future!) which adjust according to the local temperature. It is controlled with servo motors and the Spark Core microcontroller. I lead a six person team during the Hackster.io Hack to the Future hackathon to create this. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqW95cVnO0k">You can see a video of it in action here</a>, <a href="http://github.com/marty-mcsleeves">and the code here</a>. I built a web interface for the jacket with Node and Express, and deployed on Microsoft Azure.

          <span>
            A little P5.js sandbox I made as a teaching aid in order to show my friends programming fundamentals. It comes preloaded with a couple toy examples, and users can save their work.

          <a href="http://vcolavin.com/birthday_problem"><h3>Birthday Problem Calculator</h3></a>

          <span>
            My final project at Dev Bootcamp. I lead this five person team and came up with the original idea: a Momentum-like Chrome browser extension which gives users the space to dream of their dream city. It uses decoupled architecture and is built with the MEAN stack. <a href="https://github.com/Nomadr/Nomadr">View the front-end code</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/Nomadr/Nomadr-api">the back-end code</a> on Github.

          <span>
            A completely solo project at Dev Bootcamp. This app allows users to maintain a list of artists and check if they have any upcoming shows nearby. It consumes the last.fm API and filters lists of shows according to their distance from the user. ShowMe is built with Sinatra and Postgres.

          <h3><a href="http://2013.globalgamejam.org/2013/stop-listen">Stop & Listen (2013)</a></h3>
          <span>
            A computer game created in a two person team from start to finish in 48 hours for the 2013 Global Game Jam. An attempt to make a genuinely scary game with minimal, Pong-style visuals.

          <span>
            A command-line Ruby clone of hackertyper.net. It opens textfiles and can make you look like you're typing at incredible speed. I wrote this project in a couple of hours as a fun distraction, but I'm very proud of it!
